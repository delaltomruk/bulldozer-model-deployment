# end-to-end-bulldozer

I did this project as part of a Udemy course and forgot about it until recently. I've realized this is a good project to get started with model deployment, so here we are.

Going back to this beginner project also made me realize I made a lot of mistakes as a beginner, so here is my blog post about it:

# All The Modeling Stuff

As mentioned, I followed Daniel Bourke's Udemy course, so only a portion of the work is mine (see: one hot encoding and scaling).

# Deployment

I've used Heroku and Flask to deploy the model and here are the end results.
